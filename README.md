# quick-gen

## description
This repo contains the code for a command line README boilerplate generator. It prompts the user in the command line for all of the main components of a README.md file and then takes that input and lays it out into a syntactically correct file thats ready to be used! This saves tremendous amounts of time for any developer, more time can be spent on the actual code. Through this project ive learned alot about writing to the filesystem.

## Installation
To run this project on your own install the inquirer package using the command "npm i" in your command line.

## Usage 
Here is a link to a walkthrough video of a sample readme that the app generated:
